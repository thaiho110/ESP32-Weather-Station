## Day #1: Initial Setup, Brainstorming idea and preparation
I have an idea for setting up my own weather station for a pretty long time ago, but as a uni student, I probally have left it untouched for a little to long. 
So recently, since the weather where I live (HCM, Vietnam) has become a little too much unpredictable even for me, and the weather news accuracy is somewhat questionable in Vietnam (of course comparing to other developed countries,...). I thought, just for fun, why should I not start my own
weather station?

So I start researching, videos, images, and how it actually solve my problems. Since the start of 3d printing technology and the development of development boards with more powerful MCU, lots of projects including weather station has been made:

Here are a few videos that I have found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=diy+weather+station)

and many others

All of them utilized a 3D printed shell or even some components making using 3D printed parts (eg. anemometer).

## So with this part, I can ensure that there is a substantial amount of guides in the community to help me if I get stuck in the future as well as this might be able to work

Then I continue to solve the second part of the question, how can I make this beneficial to my use case? Through school courses, I know that data can be used in many different approach, one of those is machine learning and AI.

So I then research on the practicality of this method, which yields somewhat very positive results:

This leads me to further invest my time into the project!
